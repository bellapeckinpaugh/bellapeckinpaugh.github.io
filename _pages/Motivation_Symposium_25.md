# Model 1 addressing H1 & H2
## State negative affect, but not rumination, predicted future ability to recover from a mistake. This was independent of reaction time.

# Model 2 addressing H3
## Performance recovery difficulties compounded over time such that the likelihood of consecutive errors increased over the three runs.

# Trial-Level Exclusions

We excluded individual trials if: (1) participants took at least 1000ms to respond and (2) if given accuracy of a run was below 70% (Nruns = 9 from N = 5 participants; Foti et al., 2011; Imburgio et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). After exclusions, average accuracy and reaction times (RT) were: 91.3% and 409ms for Run 1; 90.2% and 413ms for Run 2; 88.7% and 412ms for Run 3.
