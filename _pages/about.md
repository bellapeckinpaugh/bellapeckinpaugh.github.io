Welcome, I am Bella! I am currently a Lab Manager in Maital Neta's Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am passionate about research that can lead to downstream treatment options. I am particularly interested in targeting high-risk adolescents, those who are at higher risk of developing depression due to a parental history of depression. I aim to study the transmission of depression by examining emotion regulation, negative cognition, and interpretation biases in parent-child dyads. I want to help improve treatment options so that adolescents with a parental history of depression, do not develop a depressive episode themselves.
