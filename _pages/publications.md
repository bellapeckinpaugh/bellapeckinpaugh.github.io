## [1. Negative Emotion (dys)regulation Predicts Distorted Time Perception: Preliminary Experimental Evidence and Implications for Psychopathology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12988)

**_Objective_** <br>
Accurate time perception is crucial to daily life but vulnerable to interference, particularly through negative affect, which dilates individuals' sense of time passing. Regulation strategies like rumination, and disorders like borderline personality disorder (BPD), are linked to time distortion, yet their interrelationships remain untested. We investigated whether rumination and BPD symptoms increase time dilation in negative affective states to understand the clinical implications of time distortion. <br>
  **_Methods_** <br>
In an online pilot study, we tested whether negative affect (NA) predicts subjective time perception and explored how rumination, BPD symptoms, and their interaction predicted time perception using a between-subjects online experimental mood induction. Adult participants (Ncombined = 760) were recruited from Prolific Academic and a large, Midwestern U.S. university. <br>
  **_Results_** <br>
State NA and increased BPD features predicted increased time dilation. The role of trait-level rumination was nuanced, with individuals low in BPD symptoms and elevated trait rumination exhibiting reduced time dilation in response to NA. Conversely, those with elevated rumination and BPD symptoms reported increased time dilation in the neutral condition. <br>
  **_Conclusion_** <br>
Findings offer foundational evidence of NA and rumination's roles in time dilation for individuals across levels of BPD symptom endorsement. Subsequent replication and extension could flesh out these relationships and inform psychotherapeutic treatment targets. <br>

## [1. Perceived social support attenuates increased hostile reactions to traumatic threat](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.23567) <br>

**_Objective_** <br>
Extant literature has seldom examined the naturalistic role of reaction to threat on downstream emotional distress while also considering buffers, such as perceived social support, to acute negative mental health outcomes. The present study examined how trauma symptoms, in reaction to a global stressor, predicted increased psychological distress via elevated emotional hostility and whether perceived social support modified such effects. We predicted a priori that increased exposure to trauma would be associated with increased hostility and global psychological distress, but that this path would be attenuated by greater levels of perceived social support, as individuals who report greater support exhibit greater emotional coping.<br>
**_Methods_** <br>
We recruited 408 adults from a large university in the Midwestern United States to participate in a survey assessing past-week trauma, hostility, distress, and perceived social support following the initial COVID-19 lockdown. The survey was conducted in March 2020, directly after strict shelter-in-place orders were locally mandated. To test our hypotheses, we employed a moderated mediation analysis approach. <br>
**_Results_** <br>
Results demonstrate that higher trauma predicted increased hostility, which in turn predicted increased distress, and trauma predicted distress via hostility (an indirect effect). As hypothesized, higher perceived social support attenuated the association between trauma and hostility. <br>
**_Conclusion_** <br>
Results support a hostile emotional pathway that may increase distress in the context of increased traumatic impact; however, social support likely buffers these effects, particularly in the face of new or novel threats and stressors. Findings suggest broad application for understanding the relation between the introduction of stressors, psychological distress, and social support. <br>
