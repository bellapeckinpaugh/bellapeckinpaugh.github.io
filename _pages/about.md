Welcome, I am Bella! I am currently a Lab Manager in Maital Neta's [Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://canlab.unl.edu/) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I graduated with a B.S. in Psychology from Purdue University. While at Purdue, I was in Dan Foti's [Psychophysiological Analysis of Cognition, Emotion, and Reward Lab](https://www.pacer-lab.com/) and Sean Lane's [Regulation of Emotion, Addiction, and Conflict Trajectory](https://reactlab.wixsite.com/reactlab)! 


I am passionate about research that can lead to downstream treatment options. I am particularly interested in targeting high-risk adolescents, those who are at higher risk of developing depression due to a parental history of depression. I aim to study the transmission of depression by examining emotion regulation, negative cognition, and interpretation biases in parent-child dyads. I want to help improve treatment options so that adolescents with a parental history of depression, do not develop a depressive episode themselves.




In my free time I love to read, go for walks, and take care of my plants. I've added some pictures of my plants below ðŸ˜Š
